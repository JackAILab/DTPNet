**Abstract**: Many effective components have been proposed for feature learning for image-acquired rain removal tasks. However, few models consider how to combine multi-scale features of these rainy images. The effective coupling between multi-scale features in the image derain model can further improve the authenticity and detail of image derain. In this paper, we propose a migratable multi-scale feature mixture model, which is a progressive learning model based on detail dilation and texture extraction. First, the degraded image will be sent to the detail expansion module designed by us to enlarge the detail outline and obtain the rough features of the image. Then, the extracted feature maps will be sent to the multi-scale feature extraction (MFE) module and multi-scale hybrid strategy (MHS)module for refined texture restoration. We then replace simple convolution modules with an optimized Transformer model to better extract contextual features and multi-scale information in images.** **Finally, we use a progressive learning strategy to inpaint the degraded images step by step. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed progressive inpainting module can almost achieve state-of-the-art performance in a variety of rain removal tasks. Specially, our model also has a better advantage in terms of image derain realism than state-of-the-art models.
